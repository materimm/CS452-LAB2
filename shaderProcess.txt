Shader Process

The process of the shader program: 

First the shader file is passed into the loadShader function. 
This function opens the file and gets the length of the file. It then
makes a buffer based on the file size. It stores the file into this
buffer. The buffer is then returned. Next the createShader function
is passed the buffer and the type. It then compiles and creates the
shader. Next the createProgram function takes a list of all the 
created shaders. It then creates a program and then takes each 
shader from the list and links the shader to the program. The 
program is then created and used.
